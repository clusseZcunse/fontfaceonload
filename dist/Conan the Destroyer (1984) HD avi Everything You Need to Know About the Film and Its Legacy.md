Conan the Destroyer also features some interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes stories. For example, the production had a hard time finding a horse for Wilt Chamberlain to ride, because he was so tall that his feet touched the ground. They eventually found one in Spain that was big enough and imported it to Mexico[^1^]. Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain did not get along on set, and Jones put two stuntmen in the hospital by accident with her fighting stick[^1^]. Arnold Schwarzenegger gained U.S. citizenship during the filming of Conan the Destroyer, and he retains dual Austrian and U.S. citizenship to this day[^2^].
 
Conan the Destroyer is not without its flaws, however. The film was originally intended to be darker and more violent, like its predecessor, but Universal Studios wanted to make it more family-friendly and appeal to a wider audience. The film was heavily rewritten and toned down, which disappointed Schwarzenegger and director Fleischer. The film also suffered from some poor editing and dubbing, which affected the continuity and quality of some scenes. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its entertainment value but criticized its plot and tone.
 
Despite its shortcomings, Conan the Destroyer is still a classic sword and sorcery adventure that has a loyal fan base. The film showcases Schwarzenegger's charisma and physical prowess, as well as his chemistry with his co-stars. The film also features impressive sets, costumes, and special effects that create a vivid fantasy world. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $31 million in the United States and more than $100 million worldwide. It spawned a spin-off film, Red Sonja (1985), starring Brigitte Nielsen as the female warrior and Schwarzenegger as a supporting character. A third Conan film, titled Conan the Conqueror, was planned but never materialized. However, Schwarzenegger has expressed interest in returning to the role of Conan in a future project.
